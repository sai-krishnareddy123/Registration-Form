This project is a **responsive registration form** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that demonstrate 
client-side form validation with real-time user feedback. The form collects essential details such as **Name, 
Email, and Password**, validating them using **regular expressions** to ensure data integrity. It enforces rules
like a non-empty name, a properly formatted email, and a strong password containing at least 8 characters, one
uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. Clear **error messages** are
displayed below each field if validation fails, while a **success message** is shown when all inputs are valid.
The design is styled with a clean, modern UI featuring a centered card layout, rounded corners, and hover effects
for better user experience. This project is ideal for beginners learning **front-end development**,
 **form validation**, and **regex usage**, and it can be extended with features like confirm password, database 
 connectivity, or mobile responsiveness.
